# Backend API â€“ Laravel

This is the backend API for rollective, built with **Laravel 11** and using **SQLite** for the database.  
Authentication is handled via **Laravel Sanctum**.  
The `fileinfo` PHP extension is required and must be enabled.

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.4.3** or newer
- **Composer** (dependency manager for PHP)
- **SQLite** (version 3 or newer)
- **PHP extension:** `fileinfo` (must be enabled in `php.ini`)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**

   Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Enable the fileinfo extension**

   Make sure the following line is present and **not commented out** in your `php.ini`:

   ```
   extension=fileinfo
   ```

   Check if it's enabled:

   ```bash
   php -m
   ```

   You should see `fileinfo` in the output.

3. **Database setup**

   - This project uses **SQLite** as its database.
   - The SQLite file will be created automatically when you run the migration and seed commands.
   - No additional `.env` configuration is required for the backend.

4. **Run migrations and seeders**

   Create the database schema and populate it with initial data:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   Start the server with:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The server will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
